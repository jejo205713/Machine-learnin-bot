# Machine-learnin-bot

Just created a machine learning chat bot using Python!🤖🐍🤝

The bot's current model learns as we teach it, and replies with the learned information back to the questions. It uses a knowledge.json file to save the provided information and then draws data from it when questioned.📚🤔

Excitingly, I'm working on integrating an AI module into it, which will undoubtedly enhance its learning capabilities!🚀🌟
